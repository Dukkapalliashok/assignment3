  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the
  presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as
  HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2] CSS is a
  cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
  JavaScript.[3] Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Logo by The CSS-Next Community

  designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including
  layout, colors, and fonts.[4] This separation can improve content
  accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its
  presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
  presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
  specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity
  and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be
  cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
  and its formatting.
